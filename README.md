# PPMS_measure
 
spin_pumping.py: a code to measure spin pumping. Microwave input is generated through e8257d source.Inverse spin Hall voltage is measured through SR830 lockin amplifer. PPMS controls the magnetic field and temperature. 

pulse_current_PPMS_module.py: a code to measure current induced magnetization switching. Current pulse is from 2901 SouceMeter. Voltage is measured by 2182 nonavoltage meter. PPMS controls the magnetic field and temperature. 

Rotataor_PPMS_module_6221.py: a code to measure second harmonic resistance or Hall. AC current generated by 6221. Voltage is measured through SR830 lockin amplifer. PPMS controls the sample position, magnetic field and temperature.
